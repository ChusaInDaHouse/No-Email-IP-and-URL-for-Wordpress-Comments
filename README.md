# No Email, IP and URL for Wordpress Comments
A very simple plugin to remove Email and Website fields from comments area and also stop collecting the commenter's IP address.

Roadmap:
- Add function to automatically disable the "Comment author must fill out name and email" option in Settings -> Discussion
- Add options page with options to enable/disable comment cookie and collect IP address
