# No Email, IP and URL for Wordpress Comments

A pretty simple plugin to remove Email and Website fields from comments area and also stop collecting the commenter's IP address. Also disables comment system cookie and empties comment notes text. 
Includes a settings page to selectively disable or enable any of these Wordpress Comments features as needed. 
Now it also removes Email field for WooCommerce reviews if the "Remove Email field" option is set.
